# FMPXMLRESULT2generator

FMPXMLRESULT2generator is a project to convert data quickly from FileMaker and to keep the attribute/entity/column/table/field names

## General note â€“ stylesheet regardless

None of these are candidates for a beauty contest; all of them however are made with one thought in mind, FileMaker as the single source of truth, a high level of conformity across your solution, natively on all accounts. The intended use is for these stylesheets to serve as a quick starting point for generating a native interface with FileMaker as the single source of truth and high conformity across your solution.

No records required; however exporting a random record may give you extra data to work with.

### CRUD is often confusing

as CRUD only contains 4 letters; here is a good read on the difference between the 2 Us in CRUD; namely PATCH and PUT: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28459418/rest-api-put-vs-patch-with-real-life-examples#34400076 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28459418/rest-api-put-vs-patch-with-real-life-examples/39338329#39338329

## This is a PoC( Proof of Concept )

Note adding a layout name in the FMPXMLRESULT export; before translating using this XSLT, will make the output more complete.

<img alt="[x] Format Using Layout will provoke the export to populate the LAYOUT-attribute" src="FormatUsingLayout.png" width="100%" max-width=1008>

How to use these files in terminal
---
```bash
$ xsltproc fmpxmlresult2nodeexpress.xslt test.xml > ~/projectname/route/view.js
```

For using this in FileMaker use File -> Export Records use filetype XML and point to the raw file on github for the [XSLT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TyrfingMjolnir/fmpxmlresult2nodeexpress/master/fmpxmlresult2nodeexpress.xslt)

If you do not like the verbs used for the calls you can have a look [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/630453/put-vs-post-in-rest) to do some qualified changes. Perhaps using patch instead of put for your UPDATE will be for the better?

// To be called from app.js like this: app.use('/contact', require('./contact'));
const

// Create

## fmpxmlresult2nodeexpressFullCRUD.xslt

This file loads every field/column as a potential parameter in the template, there's most likely no purpose to use all fields as parameters, however it must be easier to delete those you do not need than to risk a typo. After all removing the source of human failure in the naming and typo department is the main goal of these scripts.
